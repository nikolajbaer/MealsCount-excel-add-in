# MealsCount-excel-add-in

The end goal of this project is to provide an Excel add-in to make it easier for users to access [MealsCount data](https://github.com/opensandiego/mealscount-backend).

Based on the work of [James Goddard](https://github.com/jameswgoddard), this branch has been updated based on the more dev-env neutral [Yeoman generator for Office Add-Ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office). 

The application specific code mostly lives in taskpange/*.html, *.js, and *.css
